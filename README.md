They are currently using a very complex system to manage memberships, payments, and attendance and often encounter problems arising from confusion and misunderstandings.

Individualized promos with customers will increase member satisfaction and loyalty. The reasoned prediction will be based on the data obtained, and it can be further developed to include more services in a larger gym environment.
